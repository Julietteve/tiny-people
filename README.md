# Project 0

I quite admire people who can express such strong emotions so easily . Lately I 've been impressed by this young and growing artist and the way he compones his organic digital paintings. I decided that I could borrow some of his works and write a simple and little project, mostly based on the visual meaning of Dawid.

I stored images, css and sass files in diffetent folders in oder to keep them better organized. Most of the images are taken from their original source, just the previosly edited ones are included. I only wrote four HTML files, as it was requested as a minimum, because of the minimalistic design that I chose to apply for this project.
